- Read the Journals about the Sessa Empirical Estimator.
Convert the R codes into Python Codes (use jupyter notebook).
3. Using Simulated data 
(https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2019.00383/full) 
or a real world datasets of your choice 
(You can obtain it in Kaggle or in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/), 
perform the Sessa Empircal Estimator and generate some insights.
4. The Sessa Empirical Estimator uses 
K-Means clustering 
	(recall the disadvantages of K-Means), 
	try to substitute a different clustering algorithm, 
	generate a new insight using the new clustering algorithm.
5. Compare your results between 
Sessa Empirical Estimator using K-Means, 
and Sessa Empirical Estimator using the clustering algorithm of your choice.
6. Deadline is this Sunday, Feb 23, 2022 at 11:59 pm
7. Do this with your thesis partner.
8. You can use any A.I. assistant.

==================================================

in k-means clustering, we deicide the ammount of clusters
but in The Sessa Empirical Estimator, the k-means depend on the 
silhouette analysis for the ammount of clusters

probability density function for each cluster
